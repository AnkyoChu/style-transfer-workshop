# Style Transfer by Deep Learning

This project includes source code (and more) presented during the workshop "Style Transfer by Deep Learning".

I gave some workshops about style transfer at :
 - [Artificial Intelligence Paris - MeetUp - May 18th, 2017](http://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Artificial-Intelligence-Meetup-Paris/events/238029606/ "AI Paris MeetUp")
 - [Machine Learning Aix-Marseille - MeetUp - June 22th, 2017](http://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Machine-learning-Aix-Marseille/events/240114846/ "ML Aix-Marseille MeetUp")

And I gave some private sessions in companies about this topic.

## Install

In `install/` you will find instructions for :
 - List of dependencies (mostly TensorFlow >= 1.0.0)
 - How to create a `conda` environment with all dependencies.
 - How to build a `docker` image with all dependencies (CPU & GPU, with `nvidia-docker`.
